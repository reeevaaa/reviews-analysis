Gauravchettiyar13@gmail.com,0 reviews,0 Followers,3,"The place is good but not great. The location is amazing, it’s right opposite to JWMarriot Juhu, which makes it perfect for a breezy evening.

Few things which we really loved was,
The idea of giving free water & chips… there is a story behind it and makes it an emotional touch.
The idea of coffee tasters, I guess it’s the first cafe I have been to which does that, really loved it.

Baked vadapav and the tiny butter croissant are must try.
Vietnamese frappe & Nariyal coffee frappe both were good but not great.
Other food items were also similar.

KHILTI,0 reviews,1 Followers,3,"I visited a charming open café that offered both indoor ( less seats) and outdoor seating, creating a cozy yet refreshing vibe. What stood out the most was their thoughtful and generous service—I was welcomed with water in a canned bottle, complimentary banana chips, and later, a taster shot of the coffee I had ordered before the actual drink arrived. I absolutely loved this concept by the Ettara team, allowing a preview of the coffee experience. With its curated menu and warm atmosphere, this café is definitely going to be my new go-to spot!"

However, it has become quite crowded recently, and the waiting time has stretched to over 35 minutes. While most of the staff are friendly and accommodating, one particular staff member came across as a bit rude. Despite this, the food continues to be exceptional, making it a go-to destination for me."

Saransh Ahuja,0 reviews,100 Followers,1,"To sum it up - A waste of such good ambience and 24x7 coffee shop. A wish to have some great filter coffee outdoors in the middle of the night were squashed. The filter coffee was very bad. It was awful !! It’s an insult in the name of any coffee. Cycle wala Rs. 10 coffee is better than the filter coffee here. Plus my stomach has been upset since last night after having the coffee, must be the bad milk. Not only me , but my friends also felt the same. Never going back, you were a major disappointment"

Vishal,0 reviews,0 Followers,4,Feedback for the store. : The Vada pav is good but the packaging is flawed. The steam from the Vada pav makes the pav soggy by the time it reaches u. So the packaging needs small holes to let the steam out similar to what domino’s pizza boxes have.

ambience- sitting is not too pleasant. seems like the hotel reception staff is sitting with you. they should change arrangements. Other outside guests coming for rooms/hotel inquiry are also next to you.
coffee- maybe our choice was not right - South Indian filter coffee frappe was highly recommended by staff. it was sweet, thick, creamy but artificial creaminess type with thickner Or emulsifier. made with ready frappe mix, didn't enjoy the texture n it was too heavy."
Sapna Bhattacharya,0 reviews,0 Followers,5,"A quaint place in the premises of Juhu Residency, this place surprised me. Asif Shaikh gave us impeccable service.

Pratik Bijlani,0 reviews,16 Followers,5,"Ordering my morning breakfast from here was the best decision I have made in a while. The baked vada pav is ingenious, all the goodness of a vada pav in a bun form. Delicious and surprisingly filling. The berliner was really tasty filled with goey creamy goodness,but I'd order at least 3 of these next time to make up for the size, it's a bit small. And thank you for the banana chips, they added finely with my overall experience, thank you for making my morning such a pleasure."

Khyati Shah,0 reviews,1 Followers,5,"Finally some real coffee☕️ The place is so cozy and the staff is so warm, generous and courteous. They give you a taster to check if your coffee is right and then serve the coffee. Sabina, especially is ever smiling and makes sure you have your perfect Cuppa!!! And, the yummy banana chips that accompanies your coffee is irresistible. Oh yes, their paparoti freshly baked out of the oven is 10/10❣️"
Deepshikha Jain,0 reviews,53 Followers,5,"it's time to review this beautiful little coffee place, which has become my favourite stop on my way to work. The coffee is great but what is better is the generous staff. you ask for one chip, they will give you a bowl, just to taste. You tell them you like your coffee strong, they will literally add three times more coffee than their usual, just because.
And they will always, always smile. They usually turn a bad morning into a good one just by being generous and kind."

Vidhee Chamaria,0 reviews,8 Followers,5,I love their coffee. They serve banana chips along with it (even that’s tasty)..must try their crinkle cookies. Ms.Sabina is very courteous and serves us with a smile always!
Satinder Kaur,0 reviews,6 Followers,5,"We had wonderful time at Ettarra. Sabina was really polite, attentive and hospitable. This was my first visit based on my friend recommendation. Their filter coffee and banana chips. took me back to lanes of Kerala. Their choclate cookies melts in the mouth. Overall 9.5/10. 0.5 deducted as i strongly believe tips is by choice and not be added in the UPI payment by default. Though the biller definitely offered to cancel tips pay post confrontation, point is why are by default without informing customer by default. Such discussion leaves a bitter taste after a wonderful experience service given by folks Sabina."

H A,0 reviews,98 Followers,4,"Great coffee, better than third wave and Starbucks nearby. Their coffee tasted freshly roasted and smooth.


The waitress suggested we try their papa roti and it was so good we took 2 for take away. Buttery smooth inside with a crisp outer layer made of powdered cinnamon.


I left my cash at home and my International credit card would not work with their machine. Deepak was super kind and insisted that I come back and pay them whenever I can. 5 star service right there.


Cafe dining space is literally inside a hotel lobby. Only two tables."

Tanaz,0 reviews,135 Followers,5,Ettarra is small coffee shop in the lobby of a juhu hotel. They have an elaborate menu of South Indian coffee and espresso based drinks. They also do pour overs and drip coffee. I tried their filter coffee and it was great. Sabina took very good care of us and made the coffee to our liking. I would highly recommend.

Gauravchettiyar13@gmail.com,0 reviews,0 Followers,3,"The place is good but not great. The location is amazing, it’s right opposite to JWMarriot Juhu, which makes it perfect for a breezy evening.

Few things which we really loved was,
The idea of giving free water & chips… there is a story behind it and makes it an emotional touch.
The idea of coffee tasters, I guess it’s the first cafe I have been to which does that, really loved it.

Baked vadapav and the tiny butter croissant are must try.
Vietnamese frappe & Nariyal coffee frappe both were good but not great.
Other food items were also similar.

If you looking for breezy evening & hot coffee, please visit."
KHILTI,0 reviews,1 Followers,3,"I visited a charming open café that offered both indoor ( less seats) and outdoor seating, creating a cozy yet refreshing vibe. What stood out the most was their thoughtful and generous service—I was welcomed with water in a canned bottle, complimentary banana chips, and later, a taster shot of the coffee I had ordered before the actual drink arrived. I absolutely loved this concept by the Ettara team, allowing a preview of the coffee experience. With its curated menu and warm atmosphere, this café is definitely going to be my new go-to spot!"

But what really made our visit stand out was the service the staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their products.

But the best part of our experience was the fact that they offered us a taste before serving our drinks. This showed that they were truly committed to ensuring that we got the perfect cup of coffee, and it made all the difference.

However, it has become quite crowded recently, and the waiting time has stretched to over 35 minutes.

Despite this, the food continues to be exceptional, making it a go-to destination for me."
