Gauravchettiyar13@gmail.com,0 reviews,0 Followers,3.0,"The place is good but not great. The location is amazing, it’s right opposite to JWMarriot Juhu, which makes it perfect for a breezy evening.

Few things which we really loved was,
The idea of giving free water & chips… there is a story behind it and makes it an emotional touch.
The idea of coffee tasters, I guess it’s the first cafe I have been to which does that, really loved it.

Baked vadapav and the tiny butter croissant are must try.
Vietnamese frappe & Nariyal coffee frappe both were good but not great.
Other food items were also similar.

If you looking for breezy evening & hot coffee, please visit.",place good location right opposite jwmarriot makes perfect breezy things really loved idea giving free water story behind makes emotional idea coffee guess first cafe really loved baked vadapav tiny butter croissant must vietnamese frappe nariyal coffee frappe good food items also looking breezy evening hot please,Positive,"Food Quality, Location",Timing
KHILTI,0 reviews,1 Followers,4.0,"I visited a charming open café that offered both indoor ( less seats) and outdoor seating, creating a cozy yet refreshing vibe. What stood out the most was their thoughtful and generous service—I was welcomed with water in a canned bottle, complimentary banana chips, and later, a taster shot of the coffee I had ordered before the actual drink arrived. I absolutely loved this concept by the Ettara team, allowing a preview of the coffee experience.
